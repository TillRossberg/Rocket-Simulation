Applied physics based rocket simulation in processing. (Created by Till Roﬂberg at the HTW, 2016)

1. Simply download the processing enviroment and open one of the files in the 'Rossberg_Uebung_10'-folder.
2. Hit play!

The story: a comet flies towards the earth and the rocket should destroy it.
The task was to implement applied physics to simulate the density and air pressure of the planets atmosphere, 
the fuel usage and the size of the rocket, the size of the comet, the gravity affecting the flight of both 
rocket and comet. The hardest task was finally to implement two ways of determining when rocket and comet 
will hit and that expressed in a countdown. (We used one way invented by Konstantin Ziolkowski and the zeroing-version.)

When the countdown hits zero the rocket automatically starts (and hopefully hits). 
We wanted to implement the thrust as seen in the UI, but there wasn't enough time left.

Enjoy!:)
